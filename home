  <h1>Foot Rubs and Soup</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A small website about giving Nadia everything she’s ever wanted.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>
      This is a humble corner of the internet dedicated to one beautiful idea:
      showing Nadia love, comfort, and care in all the ways that matter.
      Whether it's warm soup on a cold day, a foot rub after a long one, or
      simply being there with kindness — the goal is simple:
      <strong>make her feel cherished every single day.</strong>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Nadia Deserves</h2>
    <p>
      Nadia deserves ease. Softness. Laughter. Rest.  
      She deserves someone who notices the little things,
      remembers what matters to her, and gives generously without being asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She deserves warmth — the literal kind, like a perfect bowl of soup,
      and the kind that comes from being loved deeply and consistently.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Everything She’s Ever Wanted</h2>
    <p>
      This site is a promise:  
      <strong>to show up, to care, to listen, to make life sweeter,
      calmer, and more joyful for her.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If Nadia wants comfort, she gets comfort.  
      If she wants rest, she gets rest.  
      If she wants connection, she gets presence.  
      If she wants foot rubs and soup—well, obviously, she gets those most of all.
    </p>
